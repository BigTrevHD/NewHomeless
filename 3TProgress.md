# Games Production Progress

## Tig, Tom, Travayne

Quick summary:

| Stage        | Mark |
| ------------ | ----:|
| Presentation | 6/10 |
| Sprint 1     |  2/4 |
| Sprint 2     |  2/4 |
| Halfway Crit | 5/10 |

### Presentation

+ In trailer there's lots of genres fighting here.
+ How will it play?
+ Notebook mechanic to record nice is a good idea.
+ Not using health - using hunger, thirst, warmth. This is a good idea and gets more to the heart of what they're trying to convey.
+ LOTS OF MECHANICS!
  - busking
  - begging
  - moving
  - shelter
  - space fighting
  - ...all with knock on effects...
- SCOPE is major issue here.
- *Can* see where this game is going.
- Prototype helps a little to see viewpoint/methods of control and how this will pan out.
- No art research at all, but art is described in GDD.
- Overscoped!

#### GDD

+ Okay. Has SWOT analysis in it.
+ Checks art influences, but there's no details of it there. Still no art research.
+ Has first 10 minutes of gameplay which is good.
+ Doesn't really have details of how all the mechanics work together. A flowchart would have helped here.
+ Gives good idea of what game will be about. Strong idea of what they're trying to portray/interrogate.

#### Total

Reasonable presentation, reasonable GDD. Solid enough of a start to the group process.

**6/10**

## Sprints

There are bi-weekly(ish) reviews where they meet with Tom Cole, as a stakeholder. We survey progress made so far and marks are given out of 4.

- 0 = No progress
- 1 = Insufficient progress
- 2 = expected progress
- 3 = better than expected progress
- 4 = amazing/outstanding/stupendous progress

### Sprint 1: Wed 6/3/19 (late - my fault)


- Paper prototype is good and gives a very strong idea of how your game will work, as well as where the decision points are and where some of the emergent gameplay is going to arise.
- Game seems to have a good structure. However I didn't see any modelling of how the 'night' mechanic will work.
- No sound research or sources as yet.
- No art research or sources as yet.
- Advice/action points:
  - Write up the rules and parameters of the game in detail to a) be clear on your game and, b) ensure that technical implementation is smooth.
  - Haven't seen anything in terms of art yet. This must be addressed now. I expect to see art research and/or sketches next time.
  - The paper prototype is working well but can be developed more to prevent you wasting time in Unity dev time. Make sure **ALL** systems are prototyped out (including night/between turns events), range of items are well thought out (prices?, worth having? too many? too few? etc.) before you put them in a digital game.

Overall, this is expected progress and is **2/4**.

Project seems on course to be fine. You have a solid base to develop from and I expect to see some good progress in the next sprint.

### Sprint 2: Thursday 14/03/19

- **2/4**
- Tom not here for sprint.
- Art (Tom's research):
  - Early start, but needs a LOT of work
  - Shame to not see more sketches.
  - Very behind. Need iteration, need sketches, need real assets.
- Music has good start.
- Get some sounds.
- Next week:
  - Art for environment and models
  - All mechanics in there in some form.
  - Full map.
  - All locations.
  - Notebook/summary of night needs to be there.

## Halfway Crit (21/03/19)

- Mechanics are **sort of** there, but the game is not playable.
  - Therefore, this is *not* alpha, this is still a prototype and you should have been further on than this now.
  - Many mechanics are marked as 'nearly working'. That kind of means they're not working. Notebook is key and 'overnight events' aren't there.
  - N.B. Priority is only fix bugs that prevent complete playthrough of game. You may have been misprioritising here.
- Game is not full size - still in testbed stage.
  - How can you play test if you don't have full arena of game?
  - **See previous sprint notes - no full map etc**.
- Art:
  - Where is it?
  - Seems undeveloped and unrefined.
  - **See previous sprint, not enough progress has been made**.
- Advice from Simon:
  - Vertex baking/vertext texturing for the voxel look you're doing.
  - Need skyboxes (avoid 'box world').
  - Gave tips on rotating the sky (stick a dome in there? Clarify with him).
- Good to hear that you're improving tech and group work skills. There seems to be some real progress at a personal level for all of you.
- _However_...Overall, given that art is very underdeveloped at this point, many mechanics are NOT actually working, and game isn't actually playable (and therefore not alpha), you're behind at this point. Can still more than make up for it though.
  - **5/10.**
